# Hello Pet

This project aims to support the pet fundations. This will be an open source project in order to create bigger impact around the world.

## Why did I decide to create this project?

First of all I'm an animal lover and I have a lot to be thankful for the pets and I've had in my whole life, this is a way to help the pets movements and support all those pets fundations which don't have a technological way to spread their labour with the world.

I want to connect those pets fundations and get more people involved to change the world for good.
